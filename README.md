# Portfolio Site

This site was built to showcase the skills I have aquired in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Ruby. The backend was built using
Rails as an API and the front end was built using JavaScript, HMTL, and CSS. The site is still in developement and will be
built out to display my resume, portfolio projects, companies I have worked with, blog posts, and contact information. This
will be were potential employers can view my skillsets and see how my coding has progessed. 

## Installation

To view the site, both the backend and frontend will need set up
  
1) Set up backend:
  * Clone the [portfolio-backend repo](https://github.com/ericlombardo/portfolio_site_backend) using the link in the top right corner
  * Run `git clone <paste_clone_link>` in desired directory
  * Navigate inside the directory and run:
    * `bundle install` 
    * `rails db:migrate`
    * `rails db:seed`
    * `rails s` to start server
  * Once you see server is running, backend setup is complete (leave this terminal open)


2) Set up frontend:
  * Clone the [portfolio-frontend repo](https://github.com/ericlombardo/portfolio_site_frontend) using the link in the top right corner
  * Run `git clone <paste_clone_link>` in desired directory
  * Navigate inside the directory and run:
    * `open index.html`
  * This will open the file up in your browser and you can view the site as if it was live

## Build Status
I am still working on the different features for the website as initially mentioned. Once the features are fully
functional I plan on hosting the site and keeping it up to date with the different projects I am working on.
